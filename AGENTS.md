# zoetrope

Terminal UI that visualizes Claude Code and Codex agent sessions as a live flow graph. The same core also runs in the browser, compiled to wasm. Read-only, zero network.

Transcript formats enter through one boundary: `src/provider/` turns records into the facts in `src/fact.rs`, and nothing past it knows the format. See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §0 before adding to either side.

See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the invariants and principles, `docs/DESIGN.md` for the module map and transcript format, `docs/HERDR-PLUGIN.md` for the Herdr bridge in `herdr-plugin/`, `TODO.md` for the roadmap, and `README.md` for usage. This fork's Firstmate fleet mode (`src/fleet/`, adapter `scripts/firstmate-fleet.py`) is specified in `docs/FIRSTMATE-FLEET.md` and operated per `docs/FLEET-USAGE.md`.

## Running

Two crates: `zoetrope` at the root (the published lib + the `zoe` binary) and `zoetrope-web` in `web/wasm/` (the browser frontend, `publish = false`, wasm32-only). The browser frontend is **excluded** from the root workspace and resolves as its own — it cannot be compiled for the host at all, so keeping it a member would mean permanent phantom errors in the editor. The commands below therefore only touch `zoetrope`; the browser frontend needs its own manifest path.

```bash
cargo build                     # native (default features)
cargo clippy                    # lint — must pass with no warnings
cargo fmt                       # format
cargo test                      # test
python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts -p 'test_*.py'   # fleet adapter; ZOE_REGENERATE_CREW=1 rewrites the adapter-generated assets/fleet/{crew,feed} fixtures

# the browser frontend (trunk → web/public/wasm/), lint it explicitly:
bash web/scripts/build-wasm.sh
cd web/wasm && cargo clippy   # its .cargo/config.toml defaults to wasm32
```

## Commits

[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/), lowercase imperative subject. Scope is a module, not a file: `fact`, `provider`, `state`, `graph`, `timeline`, `tailer`, `ui`, `panel`, `cli`, `wasm`, `web`, `herdr`, `fleet`, `api`, `docs`. `herdr` is the Herdr plugin in `herdr-plugin/`, a bridge of shell scripts that opens the focused agent pane's session in `zoe`; it ships by git clone rather than with the crate. `api` is a change to what the crate exposes rather than to one module. A change inside one provider is `provider` (e.g. `fix(provider): inherit the timestamp across progress records`).

```
feat(timeline): index the playhead by event instead of wall-clock
fix(tailer): fold appends at the live edge without rebuilding
```

`cliff.toml` sets `filter_unconventional = true` — a non-conforming commit is dropped from the changelog. Lint with `committed HEAD~1..HEAD`, generate with `git cliff -o CHANGELOG.md`.

## Maintaining this file

Keep this file for knowledge useful to almost every future agent session in this project.
Do not repeat what the codebase already shows; point to the authoritative file or command instead.
Prefer rewriting or pruning existing entries over appending new ones.
When updating this file, preserve this bar for all agents and keep entries concise.
