//! The unified replay/live timeline (a DVR).
//!
//! Live and replay are not two modes — they are one time-shifted timeline. There
//! is one ts-ordered item list ([`ReplayItem`]s) and one playhead ([`cursor`]).
//! The only real difference is whether the right edge is fixed (replay: the file
//! is complete) or growing (live: the tailer appends as the session runs).
//!
//! The edge is **always** the last event seen — never wall-clock now — so an old
//! session never grows an empty tail toward the present. **Pacing is decided by
//! the edge, not a mode:** behind the edge the cursor paces forward (compressing
//! dead air); at the edge it pins and new appends snap in; a scrub-back parks it
//! in the past and "follow" re-pins. Completion is unknowable (any session can be
//! resumed and appended to), so the feeder never stops tailing and "live" is
//! emergent (following the edge while it still grows).
//!
//! The one bit that survives is [`replay`](Timeline::replay) — the launch intent:
//! did you open a *recording to play back* or a *live session to follow*? It is
//! NOT a claim the file is complete (a replay can still grow and go live — the
//! feeder always tails, and nothing here is ever assumed finished). It's simply
//! the one thing the events can't reveal — a quiet live session is byte-identical
//! to a finished recording — so you state it at launch. It does NOT gate pacing
//! (the edge does); it only picks how liveness reads "now" — the **playhead** for
//! a replay (its timestamps are a past recording, unrelated to wall time), the
//! **wall clock** at a live edge — and whether reaching the end settles
//! interactive agents. See ARCHITECTURE.md §6.
//!
//! The Timeline owns the items and the playback state; the App owns the derived
//! `SessionModel`/`Flow` and folds the prefix `items[0..fold_target()]`. Folding
//! is incremental forward (cheap) and a rebuild only on backward seek.
//!
